## üèÜ Interview Process Overview

The typical interview loop at top product-based companies (FAANG, etc.) consists of several stages:

1.  **Recruiter Screen:** A brief call discussing your resume, experience, and high-level fit.
2.  **Technical Phone Screen (1-2 rounds):** A focused coding and algorithms assessment, often conducted on platforms like CoderPad or HackerRank.
3.  **Virtual On-Site / Final Loop (4-5 rounds):** A comprehensive set of interviews covering:
    -   **Coding & Algorithms:** Deep-dive into problem-solving.
    -   **Machine Learning & Statistics:** Theoretical and applied knowledge.
    -   **System Design (ML):** Designing scalable ML systems.
    -   **Behavioral & Product Sense:** Past experiences and business impact.

## üíª Technical Question Bank

### 1. Machine Learning Fundamentals

**Theory & Concepts**
- Explain the bias-variance tradeoff. How does it relate to overfitting and underfitting?
- What is regularization (L1/L2)? Explain the differences and when you would use each.
- Describe how cross-validation works. Why is it important?
- How would you handle an imbalanced dataset?
- Walk me through the steps of a standard machine learning project.

**Model Evaluation**
- What is the difference between precision and recall? Which metric would you optimize for in a fraud detection model and why?
- Explain ROC-AUC curve. What does an AUC of 0.5 mean? What about 1.0?
- How would you evaluate a regression model beyond just R¬≤?

**Feature Engineering**
- What feature engineering techniques have you used in your projects? (e.g., one-hot encoding, feature scaling, handling missing values, creating interaction terms).
- What is the curse of dimensionality? How does it impact model performance?

### 2. Deep Learning

**Neural Network Basics**
- Explain the concept of backpropagation. What is the role of the activation function?
- Why is ReLU a popular activation function? What are its potential problems (e.g., dying ReLU) and solutions?
- What are the common weight initialization techniques (e.g., He, Xavier)?

**Architectures**
- Explain the core components of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and why they are effective for image data.
- Compare and contrast RNNs (or LSTMs/GRUs) with Transformers. What are the advantages of Transformers for sequential data?
- Describe the attention mechanism in your own words.

### 3. Programming & Algorithms

**Python**
- *Coding:* Reverse a linked list, implement a binary search, check for a palindrome.
- *Libraries:* Demonstrate a simple data preprocessing pipeline using Pandas and Scikit-learn.
- *OOP:* Explain inheritance and polymorphism with an example.

**SQL**
- Write a query to find the second-highest salary from an `Employees` table.
- Use a window function (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`) to find the top-selling product in each category.
- Explain the differences between `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and a subquery.

### 4. ML System Design & MLOps

**System Design**
- How would you design a recommendation system for an e-commerce site like Amazon?
- Design a system to detect toxic comments on a social media platform in real-time. Consider scalability and latency.
- How would you handle a scenario where your model's performance degrades in production (model drift)?

**MLOps Concepts**
- What is the difference between batch inference and real-time inference? What are the trade-offs?
- What are the key components of an ML pipeline (e.g., feature stores, model registries, monitoring)?
- How would you version your models and data?

## üìö Study Resources

### Practice Platforms
- **LeetCode:** For algorithm and SQL practice. (Focus on Medium level).
- **DataLemur:** SQL interview questions from top companies.
- **Kaggle:** For hands-on practice with datasets and notebooks.

### Theory & Concepts
- **Book:** ["Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) by Aur√©lien G√©ron.
- **Course:** [Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops) by DeepLearning.AI.

### Mock Interviews
- **Pramp:** Free peer-to-peer mock interviews.
- **Interviewing.io:** Practice with anonymous engineers from top companies.

## üöÄ Project Ideas

Build or refine projects that demonstrate end-to-end ML prowess:
- **End-to-End ML Pipeline:** Scrape data, build a model, deploy it as a REST API (e.g., using FastAPI), and containerize it with Docker.
- **Fine-tuning a Transformer:** Fine-tune a BERT or GPT model on a specific domain task (e.g., sentiment analysis on financial news).
- **Computer Vision Project:** Build an object detection model using a framework like YOLO or Detectron2.
